# DSA-Final-Project

Final project for Data structures and algorithms class. This is a software artifact.

## Idea

Main idea is to use data structures to create a text editor which uses gap buffers and a doubly linked list to edit the buffers.

## Description

We first implement gap buffers, and test out how the text is processed with those.
Then we can implement a doubly linked list that basically take the gap buffer data structures and edit the text based on the gap position.
The gap position is the cursor position and we would be able to move the gap by adding or removing characters.
This is will be our primary implementation. Just adding and removing text using gap buffers and a doubly linked list.
